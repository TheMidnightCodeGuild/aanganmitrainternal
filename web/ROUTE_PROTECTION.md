# Route Protection Implementation

This document explains the route protection layer implemented in the application to handle authentication failures and session termination.

## Overview

The application now includes a comprehensive route protection system that automatically handles authentication failures and redirects users to the login page when their session is terminated.

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)

The AuthContext has been enhanced with:
- **Loading state**: Tracks authentication check status
- **Error handling**: Manages authentication error messages
- **Automatic logout**: Handles session termination gracefully
- **Auth failure callback**: Provides a method to handle authentication failures from API calls

### 2. Updated API Service (`src/services/apiService.js`)

The API service now includes:
- **Authentication failure detection**: Automatically detects 401/403 responses
- **Callback system**: Notifies the auth context when authentication fails
- **Token management**: Properly clears tokens on authentication failure
- **Test method**: `simulateAuthFailure()` for testing purposes

### 3. Route Protection Components

#### PrivateRoute (`src/routes/PrivateRoute.jsx`)
- Protects authenticated routes
- Shows loading spinner during authentication check
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Uses `isAuthenticated` flag for reliable authentication state

#### PublicRoute (`src/routes/PublicRoute.jsx`)
- Handles public routes (login, signup)
- Redirects authenticated users to dashboard
- Shows loading spinner during authentication check

### 4. Route Configuration (`src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx`)

Routes are now properly protected:
- Public routes: `/login`, `/signup`
- Protected routes: All other routes wrapped in `PrivateRoute`
- Home redirect: Automatically redirects based on authentication status

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Authentication Check
When the app loads:
1. AuthContext checks if a token exists in localStorage
2. If token exists, validates it with the backend
3. Sets loading state during the check
4. Updates user state based on validation result

### 2. API Request Protection
For every API request:
1. Token is automatically included in headers
2. If server returns 401/403, authentication failure is detected
3. Token is removed from localStorage
4. Auth failure callback is triggered
5. User is redirected to login page

### 3. Route Protection
- **Protected routes**: Check authentication before rendering
- **Public routes**: Redirect authenticated users away
- **Loading states**: Show spinner during authentication checks

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing
1. **Login to the application**
2. **Navigate to Settings page**
3. **Click "Test Authentication Failure" button**
4. **Verify you're redirected to login page**
5. **Check that the error message is displayed**

### API Testing
To test with real API failures:
1. **Login to the application**
2. **Manually delete the token from localStorage** (DevTools → Application → Storage)
3. **Try to access a protected route**
4. **Verify you're redirected to login**

### Backend Testing
To test with backend authentication failures:
1. **Login to the application**
2. **Modify the backend to return 401 for protected endpoints**
3. **Try to perform an action that requires authentication**
4. **Verify you're redirected to login**

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- **Session expired**: "Your session has expired. Please login again."
- **Invalid token**: Automatically cleared and user redirected
- **Server errors**: Proper error messages displayed

### User Experience
- **Loading states**: Spinner shown during authentication checks
- **Smooth redirects**: No flash of protected content
- **Clear messaging**: Users understand why they were logged out

## Security Features

1. **Automatic token validation**: Every app start validates the stored token
2. **Immediate logout**: Authentication failures immediately clear user state
3. **Route protection**: No access to protected routes without authentication
4. **Token cleanup**: Proper removal of invalid tokens

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables are required for route protection.

### Customization
To customize the implementation:
- **Loading spinner**: Modify the spinner component in route files
- **Error messages**: Update messages in AuthContext
- **Redirect paths**: Modify redirect destinations in route components

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Infinite loading**: Check if the backend `/auth/me` endpoint is working
2. **Not redirecting**: Verify that the AuthConnector is properly connected
3. **Token not clearing**: Check localStorage in DevTools

### Debug Steps

1. **Check browser console** for authentication errors
2. **Verify localStorage** has the correct token
3. **Test API endpoints** directly to ensure they work
4. **Check network tab** for failed requests

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Refresh token support**: Implement token refresh mechanism
- **Remember me**: Add persistent login option
- **Session timeout**: Add configurable session timeout
- **Multi-tab sync**: Synchronize authentication state across tabs
